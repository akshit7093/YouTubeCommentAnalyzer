[Good] @rockstarabhi9971: As a cricket fan We all have to accept the fact that Kapil Dev's 175 runs was one of the best odi innings of all time Ô∏èÔ∏è
[Good] @psuraj7116: u may not like ranveer for his life style, but trust me when its about playing character roles.. he is simply the best in this industry, he may not dress right, he may be a nuisance but when he plays character roles. he is the boss.. absolute goosebumps felt

[Good] @unknownperson9247: Some movies can't be judge by their box office collection. This is one of them.
[Good] @Batman-mf6ud: The transformation and make-up of Ranveer as Kapil Dev is UNBELIEVABLE ....This is the real tribute to the players of '83.
[Good] @sumitojha9082: 2:35
"I say before, we are here to win"
Exactly like the legend Kapil Dev.
INCREDIBLE
[Good] -: Took 38 years to know the story about the legends of 83. Goosebumps  Can‚Äôt wait for this masterpiece. Fun fact - 38 is the reverse of 83

[Good] @kunalupreti7621: no matter how ranveer acts irl, on screen his skills are unmatched, hats off bro
[Good] @michaelmiklosofficial: What a masterpiece so glad to be part of it
[Good] @yudishcallee7579: The dedication of Ranveer Singh towards his craft is outstanding and so inspiring! We all know how crazy he is in real life but when it comes to his work, he will put his life into his character and this is what reflects on the screen everytime.

I felt his best performance was Peshwa Bajirao ..but he came as Alauddin Khilji. Just when you thought Khilji is his best, he comes as Murad. Just when you thought that was maybe his career best, he comes as Kapil Dev. I can't believe this guy was Bittoo Sharma some 10 years ago. What a career graph. What versatility! What an artist. Hats off.
[Good] @avinashshivaram4457: Huge respect to Kapil Dev sir and to the entire team. Seeing this trailer i felt leading a team in 83 world cup is much much bigger achievement than leading the team today.

[Good] @praveenbabu149: Mark my words.. nobody will leave from theater without tears of joy in their eyes‚Ä¶a great tribute to our great Kapil Dev and his warriors..love from Kerala Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è
[Bad] @moumitasaha6538: I was born in Nov 1983. Just few months after the world cup. Today I  saw this movie. It is a masterpiece. I was not watching a movie.

[Good] @DillonPink: Goosebumps. Ranveer is such a talent. He's got Kapil's accent and mannerisms spot on. Blockbuster and record breaker on the way.
[Good] @ahadhussain557: I don't know why but I got emotional after seeing this, anyone else?.... this one's definitely gonna break some good records.
[Good] @spartanroxofficial9261: The voice from Kapil Paji "I say before, we are here to win" is just wow

[Good] @nxg1265: Just finished watching it and i must say it's one of the best sports-based movie. I've always doubted ranveer's acting skills but he's proved me wrong in this movie. The movie doesn't only show Kapil's accomplishment but also the skills of the other players and let alone the indian players skills but also the opponent's. The way the indians were  reunited by the game and thier expression of joy was 10/10. TOO GOOD
[Good] @ssagar8808: Srikanth saying- "Aye kya paagal ho gya h re hamara captain" 
That was awesome. Same talking style . Srikanth himself has told this story in many interviews. 
Jiva as Srikanth would be the best to watch in the movie.Srikanth is hilarious.
[Good] @sreeragjayaprakash1206: By seeing Jeeva's acting as Cheeka, one thing is sure. Each and every expressions and every mannerisms of other actors are near perfect. Kudos

[Good] @TheSiddharthKothari: I saw this Movie Yesterday. The whole Theatre was re-living the moment. The movie was long but no one realised. Hats-off to the film-makers for such a marvelous film. This team of 1983 world cup taught India to win! A Must watch movie for all.
[Good] @DaniellaPark72: I'm not from India but i can say this movie is parallel to Bohemian Rhapsody. The way it was captured is just so on point and the cast did amazing job!
[Good] @aarav.129: The look and accent, especially ( ùô¨ùôö ùôùùôöùôßùôö ùô©ùô§ ùô¨ùôûùô£) and language Of ranveer Singh completely matches with the living legend Kapil Dev sir... And ranveer Singh has nailed it...

[Normal] @rishi.gupta27: This is not a biopic of "Kapil Dev" it's a journey of those members who were rated as underdogs and they captured the World Cup 
[Good] @pattuwale7629: As a Madras native, I say the filmmakers have captured Chika (Kris Srikkanth) with 100% accuracy. The twitch & sniffle, mad max batting technique, cigarette smoking, and most of all, the accent and attitude. Top class! Looks like a great movie!

[Good] @jatinmorwal1522: The casting has been amazing.... The scene where Chikka sir was talking about Kapil dev felt so real.....
[Good] @yonatanschlussel: Just watched this and it's probably one of the best movies I've ever seen. The pride surging throughout the film for a country you're not even part of is unexplainable.

[Normal] @engadge: Just 35 years after independence India was like an adolescent child who was just breaking out of puberty... India as a nation was poor, cutely innocent, underconfident and very humble... This win was the first spurt for this nation... And it looks like this country is not gonna look back now... Go India
[Good] @srishtubaby: The trailer made me a little emotional. Imagine how our nation would have felt at that time. These are the movies which we crave for.
[Good] @amanw29: Literally had tears in my eyes watching this trailer. ‚Ä¶ Can‚Äôt imagine how special this 1983 World Cup would have meant for them

[Good] @roshankumar-pp9nj: When cricket was not for brands or advertising commercials. World cup then was purer and original. Earned with battle hardened love for country only by one and only team of the world. Kapil's and his only eleven. Not just an Indian team by any standards. It was the rest of the world against Kapil's eleven.

[Good] @fellowgoodie: I remember watching this match on DD live. After India won the match, DD telecasted the whole match again the following day (not the highlights, the whole match) and remember one-day cricket was 60 overs each, back then.
Also for those who say this was a fluke win, remember India defeated WI in the opening match  of this World cup as well, so they knew they were capable of doing it again.
[Good] @AbdulHadi-vv1ye: I am from Pakistan but I am a huge fan of living legens like Kapil Dev, Imran Khan etc, this movie gave me goosebumps and Pakistan also came into world cup 92 as cornered tigers but Khan motivated his team to lift the WC, I wish Pakistan film industry should make a biopic of Khan as well.

[Normal] @adityadanani970: Happy Birthday Ranveer Singh
[Bad] @tajammulsiddiq9880: I have just watched a few minutes of this movie and this movie looks very interesting. Just sharing my observations regarding a few dialogues which I seem not helpful for people especially youth. Those dialogues are used for motivating a team but not helpful when they face setbacks(loss).

1. A scene where a child says "Papa match dikhanay laatay hi nhn kion k hamari team match Jeet ti hi nhn" 

Instead of Silence or being Sad, Here Player (Ranveer Singh) should have said  " Baita Khail (Sport) daikhnay ana chahyay ..Sports main bohat seekhnay ko milta hai, healthy activity hai, Haar Jeet Tau Khail ka hissa hai" 

2. Ammi hamesha kahti Hain Baita Jeet k ana. Here Ammi should have said " Baita pori koshish Karna, dum lagana, apna 100% daina, Haar bhi jao Tau koi regret(Afsoos) nhn Hoga kion k tm ne apni pori mahnat ki hai, Haar bhi jao Tau agli bar aur mahnat Karna, apni ghaltiyun ko repeat na karna"

3.  Where workers are enjoying watching a World cup match, suddenly Boss/Manager(having European background) came and said "Go back to work" with a very harsh tone. This is an example of stereotyping which reflects that all Boss/Managers having European background are harsh with people who have Non European background.

[Good] @openscienceforum4649: A movie is not about its commercial success. Sometimes it is all about the story that must be told. This is one such story that was worth every penny of the production team's investment. 

One of the finest movies I have seen in my life. Watch to know what a man with a fire in his belly can achieve for his team, nation, and himself. 

The movie teaches a lot about leadership skills. Kapil Dev was a leader who inspired his team to be their best version. He held the highest standards of performance. Kapil Dev's attitude and his mental strength was as important as his cricketing skills.

In the initial part and the middle part of the movie, Sunil Gavaskar role in a team presented as being self centered (focused on only oneself) which is contrary to his approach.

The reason behind the flop of this movie is the scene where they have shown Sandhu Sir washing his heads. 

They disrespected Sikhs that's why the movie flopped and all movies will flop who will disrespect Sikhs. 

When munmun datta called sc st - bhangi. Fir was filed against her. If you say arunchal pradesh is china you get jail then why everybody can make fun of Sikhs. Such people be jailed too.

We can blame the BCB all we want but its upto the passion and dedication of the players that are performing on the field.

[Good] @squidjames7735: Have largely lost interest in Bollywood (and K, T, and other 'Woods) but this movie was great as I am a keen sports follower, but not much cricket. 
The movie had songs, but they were not silly willy types, made sense and were in sync with the emotions displayed by the various characters. 
Lots of interesting themes:
1). brits still treating desis like donkeys, racism, underclass, discrimination 
2). the typical stereotyping ... short, slow and unfit
3). the stupidity of cricket admin to support their players properly 
4). the disadvs faced by players ... going to hospital in a taxi with a broken and bleeding jaw was shocking
5). the need for all races in India to come together, such a cliche now, sadly
6). the respect for the captain (Kapsi)
7). the burden of the whole nation
8). playing the underdog, and not reacting to taunts in media, fans, field, opponents, etc. 
9). true brotherhood as another stepped up when one fell short 
10). support from family ... back home and partners who came to watch the finals in person. 

Jai Hind!
Satyamev Jayate!
