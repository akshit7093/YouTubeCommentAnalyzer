@jeswinraju1547,Disappointed by how people treated this movie in theatres. This is a masterpiece which left me in tears. Cricket is one thing in India that people celebrate irrespective of religion and caste.
@TOP10STAR,i was not even born in 1983 but thanks to bringing those world cup memory again. This is the story of India's first Hero KAPIL DEV 
@srinivasnahak3473,"The best part about the trailer is ""It doesn't just revolve around Ranveer Singh.."" it has also given importance to other characters..which is truly commendable "
-,Ranveer has played his Role has captain Kapil Dev marvellously. What an amazing movie ‚Äú83‚Äù we can only imagine the atmosphere and how India felt when wining the world championships Ô∏è
-,Ranveer during the interview scene definitely felt like Kapil Dev  . Great casting. Another Kabir Khan Mega blockbuster Ô∏è
@prakhart92,"A lesser known fact :
Mohindar Amarnath was man of the match in both Semi-finals and finals.

So excited to watch this.üáÆüá≥"
@bharathhegde9931,My dad said 83 world cup was special to a whole Indian nation... I saw a proud  happiness in his eyes when he use to speak about it... Sad my dad is not there to see this movie now... After seeing this trailer I got goosebumps looks fantastic looks so realistic.. Hats off to ranveer singh
@nishiali3007,"Just saw this movie.....it's commendable 
Best part is, it doesn't revolves around just one person/ player, it shows u the journey and struggle of whole Indian team."
@rockstarabhi9971,As a cricket fan We all have to accept the fact that Kapil Dev's 175 runs was one of the best odi innings of all time Ô∏èÔ∏è
@psuraj7116,"u may not like ranveer for his life style, but trust me when its about playing character roles.. he is simply the best in this industry, he may not dress right, he may be a nuisance but when he plays character roles. he is the boss.. absolute goosebumps felt"
@samrikasinha5926,"After MS DHONI-the untold story, this is another enthralling biopic masterpiece!! Loved it."
@unknownperson9247,Some movies can't be judge by their box office collection. This is one of them.
@Batman-mf6ud,The transformation and make-up of Ranveer as Kapil Dev is UNBELIEVABLE ....This is the real tribute to the players of '83.
@sumitojha9082,"2:35
""I say before, we are here to win""
Exactly like the legend Kapil Dev.
INCREDIBLE"
-,Took 38 years to know the story about the legends of 83. Goosebumps  Can‚Äôt wait for this masterpiece. Fun fact - 38 is the reverse of 83 
@eshwarajith7877,"a shame that this movie flopped box office. such aa heart touching movie and conveys so much on never ever give up. respect to kabir khan, kapil dev and all the other actors. totally loved this film."

@rahulbose2334,"No matter what,whenever Ranveer acts on any character he not only gives his 100%, but I would say 300%.Thats his style.Copying a legend like Kapil Dev Sir is not a joke ,and he has done that truly from his heart.Hats of to the entire team and Kabir Khan to bring those memories back..."
@kunalupreti7621,"no matter how ranveer acts irl, on screen his skills are unmatched, hats off bro"
@michaelmiklosofficial,What a masterpiece so glad to be part of it
@yudishcallee7579,"The dedication of Ranveer Singh towards his craft is outstanding and so inspiring! We all know how crazy he is in real life but when it comes to his work, he will put his life into his character and this is what reflects on the screen everytime.

I felt his best performance was Peshwa Bajirao ..but he came as Alauddin Khilji. Just when you thought Khilji is his best, he comes as Murad. Just when you thought that was maybe his career best, he comes as Kapil Dev. I can't believe this guy was Bittoo Sharma some 10 years ago. What a career graph. What versatility! What an artist. Hats off."
@avinashshivaram4457,Huge respect to Kapil Dev sir and to the entire team. Seeing this trailer i felt leading a team in 83 world cup is much much bigger achievement than leading the team today.

@moumitasaha6538,I was born in Nov 1983. Just few months after the world cup. Today I  saw this movie. It is a masterpiece. I was not watching a movie. Its seems to be I am watching the world cup. Enjoying every moment of it. My father was very much fond of cricket. I wish if he was here today. He could have revive his 83 moment once again. In every scene I missed my father.

@sanyakalra6376,Ranveer Singh is here to prove again that he is just here to win..what an incredible actor
@kratos692,Unpopular opinion but one of my favorite scene is when Boman Irani who was playing the Indian commentator moved to tears. It cut after only a few seconds but was very powerful.
@DillonPink,Goosebumps. Ranveer is such a talent. He's got Kapil's accent and mannerisms spot on. Blockbuster and record breaker on the way.

@jehanmi,I am a Sri Lankan who at the age of 18 years old had the chance of meeting the great Kapil Dev in Colombo Sri Lanka. This movie was a testament to his humble character. I am so sad that I didn‚Äôt know it was released in theaters.
@maggumagar,"1. They actually selected punjabi actors for punjabi players.

@nxg1265,Just finished watching it and i must say it's one of the best sports-based movie. I've always doubted ranveer's acting skills but he's proved me wrong in this movie. The movie doesn't only show Kapil's accomplishment but also the skills of the other players and let alone the indian players skills but also the opponent's. The way the indians were  reunited by the game and thier expression of joy was 10/10. TOO GOOD
@ssagar8808,"Srikanth saying- ""Aye kya paagal ho gya h re hamara captain"" 
That was awesome. Same talking style . Srikanth himself has told this story in many interviews. 
Jiva as Srikanth would be the best to watch in the movie.Srikanth is hilarious."

@rishabhmishra382,Ranveer has established himself as one of the most class apart actors and the way he enters a role and enters a personality seems like he is living that person. Amazing movie amazing cast. Looking forward to this amazing movie

@adityadanani970,Happy Birthday Ranveer Singh
@tajammulsiddiq9880,"I have just watched a few minutes of this movie and this movie looks very interesting. Just sharing my observations regarding a few dialogues which I seem not helpful for people especially youth. Those dialogues are used for motivating a team but not helpful when they face setbacks(loss).

1. A scene where a child says ""Papa match dikhanay laatay hi nhn kion k hamari team match Jeet ti hi nhn"" 

Instead of Silence or being Sad, Here Player (Ranveer Singh) should have said  "" Baita Khail (Sport) daikhnay ana chahyay ..Sports main bohat seekhnay ko milta hai, healthy activity hai, Haar Jeet Tau Khail ka hissa hai"" 

2. Ammi hamesha kahti Hain Baita Jeet k ana. Here Ammi should have said "" Baita pori koshish Karna, dum lagana, apna 100% daina, Haar bhi jao Tau koi regret(Afsoos) nhn Hoga kion k tm ne apni pori mahnat ki hai, Haar bhi jao Tau agli bar aur mahnat Karna, apni ghaltiyun ko repeat na karna""

3.  Where workers are enjoying watching a World cup match, suddenly Boss/Manager(having European background) came and said ""Go back to work"" with a very harsh tone. This is an example of stereotyping which reflects that all Boss/Managers having European background are harsh with people who have Non European background."

@openscienceforum4649,"A movie is not about its commercial success. Sometimes it is all about the story that must be told. This is one such story that was worth every penny of the production team's investment. 

One of the finest movies I have seen in my life. Watch to know what a man with a fire in his belly can achieve for his team, nation, and himself. 

The movie teaches a lot about leadership skills. Kapil Dev was a leader who inspired his team to be their best version. He held the highest standards of performance. Kapil Dev's attitude and his mental strength was as important as his cricketing skills."

@nehazsharma6624,"Hindus should know that Ramji also has a Jura and should respect sikhs who saved Hindus from Aurangzeb. 

The reason behind the flop of this movie is the scene where they have shown Sandhu Sir washing his heads. 

They disrespected Sikhs that's why the movie flopped and all movies will flop who will disrespect Sikhs. 

When munmun datta called sc st - bhangi. Fir was filed against her. If you say arunchal pradesh is china you get jail then why everybody can make fun of Sikhs. Such people be jailed too."

@batman5754,Jeeva fans hit like
@KEERTHANist,Watching now in Hot star. Honestly I think movie is not upto the mark. Not reached the expectations we got from trailer. Fully boaring screen play. Emotional songs which generates zero emotions rather simply drags movie time. Back ground score is dull. Editing not upto the mark. Comedy also zero.
@hridoy4144,"India audiences are totally Rubbish
They prefer cringe mashla flim like Pushpa radhe kgf shahoooo etc !!
They didn't  watch masterpiece films  like 83 , Swadesh , tumbaad , Tamasha ,fan etc that's why India wouldn't get Oscar till now "

@sapaktv255,Chke fairy 2 tale
@vk06,The movie was very good. The younger generation got to know about the emotions of 1983 world cup won. However the end of the movie ruined everything. Again pakistan appeasement. Showing the fake'good image' of them while firing happened that day and it was started by them. Our brave soldiers become martyrs only for this? Horrible appeasement. Urduwood has to come out of this or else they will go on to give flops. Shameless!!
@vijitmathur4152,Ranveer singh played well in acting but sushant was better in ms dhoni ms dhoni is beete than 83
@NoVideo2024,"Propaganda film. Only if they limited the film upto Kapil Dev and 1983 match, it'd have been a blockbuster but inserting propaganda of Muslims celebrating cricket amidst riots and Pakistan army stopping fire for match is utter bullshit"
@BinduKumarM,This is a flop due to nepotism in Bollywood ...RIP Bollywood...south Indian movies going to rule movie market in India
@ImSadiaNadeem,"Cricket movies doesn't attract public's attention, ridiculous and useless addition of lots of things."

@prakashreddy7956,We won IJJAT in 1983 not in 1947
@TureshwarHansraj,Ofc they would make a movie of the 1983 WC which was 41 years ago because they have nothing else to celebrate about in recent times‚Ä¶
@squidjames7735,"Have largely lost interest in Bollywood (and K, T, and other 'Woods) but this movie was great as I am a keen sports follower, but not much cricket. 
The movie had songs, but they were not silly willy types, made sense and were in sync with the emotions displayed by the various characters. 
Lots of interesting themes:
1). brits still treating desis like donkeys, racism, underclass, discrimination 
2). the typical stereotyping ... short, slow and unfit
3). the stupidity of cricket admin to support their players properly 
4). the disadvs faced by players ... going to hospital in a taxi with a broken and bleeding jaw was shocking
5). the need for all races in India to come together, such a cliche now, sadly
6). the respect for the captain (Kapsi)
7). the burden of the whole nation
8). playing the underdog, and not reacting to taunts in media, fans, field, opponents, etc. 
9). true brotherhood as another stepped up when one fell short 
10). support from family ... back home and partners who came to watch the finals in person. 

Jai Hind!
Satyamev Jayate!"
